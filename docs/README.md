### Project Requirements (broad TODO list):
- [ ] Perform CRUD on SoftwareProjects
    - Fields: name, description, list of tasks, online resources, bugs, members
- [ ] Perform CRUD on Tasks (Project.id = foreign key)
    - Divided into 3 buckets: TODO, WIP, Done
    - timestamps for creation, modification
- [ ] Perform CRUD on OnlineResources (Project.id = foreign key)
- [ ] Perform CRUD on SoftwareBugs (Project.id = foreign key)
- [ ] Perform CRUD on Tasks (Project.id = foreign key)
- [ ] Perform CRUD on user
    - [ ] Add login and authentication with flask_login
    - [ ] Add various roles: Developer, Product Manager Role, Admin
- [ ] Generate a short PDF report for a project
    - [ ] Give analytics of tasks
    - [ ] List member contributions
    - [ ] Append list of online resources used as reference
    - [ ] Export the report to Markdown for Github

- TODO: Full JWT based login (authentication), and role based authorization
- TODO: Add two more buckets to Tasks:
    - Backlog: Default bucket when a task is created. Only visible to product/project manager
    - Won't/Can't Do: Feature can't be implemented / dev is not going to do it. Maybe split it into 2 - wont do & can't do? Or do we need won't do? The PM can just reassign it
    - Add labels/tags to tasks: Feature, Bug Resolution, Documentation, Test, etc. (Both dev & pm can create & add them)
    - Do I need Code Review & QA buckets?? If yes, they will come in-between WIP and Done
- TODO: Task Edit/View page
    - developer: 
        - Append description? Change statusâœ“ (TODO->WIP->Done or TODO->Can't Do), Overlay in kanban board + separate task page
        - Only dev has Kanban board view: 3 buckets - TODO, WIP, Done
    - pm: 
        - Full CRUD Rights, except task status change: when task is created, it is added to backlog by default. 
        - When a task is assigned, it automatically changes status to TODO.
        - Only pm has Dashboard to track progress of a particular project: url/dashboard/<project_id>
    - add commments (only add) to a task: both pm and dev can make them
